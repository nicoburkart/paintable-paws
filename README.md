# PaintablePaws

PaintablePaws is a website where pet owners can upload pictures of their pets and and transform it into a painting. The painting process is fully automated by an neural style transfer ai. The user can select a particular art-style that the artwork should be created with. After the artwork is finished and ordered by the user it will be autmatically printed by a print on demand supplier and send to the customer.
